<div class='presentation'>
	<p>
	<i>Abstract</i>:  The workshop is a code along for those ready to start coding their first Tensorflow neural networks. 
    In this code along, we will build a single hidden layer neural network in TensorFlow sign language for digits 0 .. 6 from
    images.
    The code along includes using Jupyter Notebook, building layers in a neural network, activation functions, training and
    evaluation.
	</p>
	<p><i>Level</i>: Intermediate</p>
	<p>
	<i>Requirements</i>: Basic programming knowledge of Python is required, along with general understanding of machine learning
    concepts.
