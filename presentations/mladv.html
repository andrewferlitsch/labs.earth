	<i>Abstract</i>: This workshop introduces basic concepts on atttacking (fooling) convolutional neural networks
	into mis-classifying images. Concepts covered are weaknessness of neural networks, detecting direction of gradients in 
	pre-trained models, and methodology of exploiting the linear separability of hidden nodes.

	<p><i>Level</i>: Fundamental</p>
	<p>
	<i>Requirements</i>: No prior programming or statistics knowledge required.
