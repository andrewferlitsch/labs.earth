	<i>Abstract</i>: This workshop covers methods to automatically generate word groupings as associations, which can be used to teach associations between objects to pre-school 
	and early school children. Ex. What item does not belong?  Cat, Dog, Fire Truck, Bird

	In this presentation, I will cover how to build categorical and association dictionaries to automatically generate associations of the form, what item does not belong.
