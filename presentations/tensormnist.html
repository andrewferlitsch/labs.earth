	<p>
	<i>Abstract</i>:  TThe workshop is a code along for those ready to start coding their first Tensorflow neural networks. 
    In this code along, we start by building a Softmax Regression neural network in TensorFlow to recognize digits from the MNIST
    dataset. We then proceed to build progressively more advanced neural networks or recognizing the digits:
    <ul>
        <li>Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)</li>
        <li>Deep Neural Network (DNN)</li>
        <li>DNN with Dropout Layer and configurable Hyper-Parameters</li>
    </ul>
    The code along includes using Jupyter Notebook, building layers in a neural network, activation functions, training and
    evaluation.
	</p>
	<p><i>Level</i>: Intermediate</p>
	<p>
	<i>Requirements</i>: Basic programming knowledge of Python is required, along with general understanding of machine learning
    concepts.
