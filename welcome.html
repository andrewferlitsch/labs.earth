		Hello, my name is Andrew Ferlitsch. I oversee and direct the projects at Labs.Earth. My background is a principal research scientist in emergent technologies: 
        imaging, IoT, digital signage, teleconferencing, solar, energy management, and autonomous vehicles. I have been both a contributer and leader throughout my career in
        technical teams. I have launched and overseen a variety of social projects: community business incubator (NW Startups), open data (OpenGeoCode), and NGO/Yemen (Sincere.Global).
        I have overseen the Portland Data Science Group, growing its membership from 1500 to 2500, and increasing events from 6 to 13 events a month.
		</p>
        <p>
        I have 115 US issued patents based on my research, and have been a frequent contributer to stackoverflow, previously holding the #1 position in the open data category for two 
        continuous years.
