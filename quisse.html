		<h4>What is Quisse?</h4>
		<p>
			Quisse is designed to help individuals prepare for technical interviews. 
			Quisse consists of flashcards, multi-choice quizzes, and coding challenge tutorials.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Selecting a Category</h4>
		<p>
			There are 25 technical categories to choose from. Use the 'Select Skill Category'
			drop down to select a skill to quiz yourself on. At anytime, you can select other
			categories to quiz yourself on.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Flashcards</h4>
		<p>
		After you selected a category, you will be prompted with flashcards. Each flashcard will show
		a question. When you flip the flashcard (by clicking on it), it will show the answer. Use the
		Next buttons to advance to the next card. You can self-score yourself by selecing the Next button
		with the checkmark when you got the answer correct, or the Next button with the X when you did not
		answer the question correctly.
		</p>
		<p>
		The questions start at difficulty level 1, and will progressively advance to level 3. At each level,
		questions are selected at random. Once you've indicated you answered the question correctly, you will
		not see the question. The flashcards use an adaptive testing method to determine when to advance (or decrease)
		the difficulty level based on your self-scoring.
		</p>
		<p>
		The difficulty level of each question is dynamically determined from the history of timings and
		self-scoring from past users. Your timings and self-scoring will be added to this history - thanks for
		helping Quisse be smarter and a better product!
		</p>
		<p>
		Once the adaptive method determines you have passed, a You Passed will be displayed with a beep, and
		a button will appear to proceed to the Multiple Choice quiz section.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Multiple Choice Quiz</h4>
		<p>
		Once you have completed the flashcard section, you can select the Start Quiz button to start the
		multiple choice quiz section. In this section, you will be presented with a question and four choices
		for answers, of which only one is correct. If you select the correct choice, a Correct will be displayed;
		otherwise a Not Correct will be displayed. Use the Next button to go to the next question.
		</p>
		<p>
		The questions start at difficulty level 1, and will progressively advance to level 3. At each level,
		questions are selected at random. Once you have answered a question correctly, you will not see it again.
		The multiple choice use an adaptive testing method to determine when to advance (or decrease)
		the difficulty level based on your scoring.
		</p>
		<p>
		The four choices consist of the correct answer and three wrong answers. The three wrong answers
		come from the answers to questions in the same category. A natural language processing (NLP) method
		is used to compare a question for similarity to other questions in the category. The answers to
		questions determined to be similar are then used as the wrong answers to the question.
